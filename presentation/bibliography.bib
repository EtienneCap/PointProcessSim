	abstract = {Hawkes processes are important in point process theory and its applications, and simulation of such processes are often needed for various statistical purposes. This article concerns a simulation algorithm for unmarked and marked Hawkes processes, exploiting that the process can be constructed as a Poisson cluster process. The algorithm suffers from edge effects but is much faster than the perfect simulation algorithm introduced in our previous work Moller and Rasmussen (2004). We derive various useful measures for the error committed when using the algorithm, and we discuss various empirical results for the algorithm compared with perfect simulations. Extensions of the algorithm and the results to more general types of marked point processes are also discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Spatial Point Patterns: Methodology and Applications with R shows scientific researchers and applied statisticians from a wide range of fields how to analyze their spatial point pattern data. Making the techniques accessible to non-mathematicians, the authors draw on their 25 years of software development experiences, methodological research, and broad scientific collaborations to deliver a book that clearly and succinctly explains concepts and addresses real scientific questions. Practical Advice on Data Analysis and Guidance on the Validity and Applicability of Methods The first part of the book gives an introduction to R software, advice about collecting data, information about handling and manipulating data, and an accessible introduction to the basic concepts of point processes. The second part presents tools for exploratory data analysis, including non-parametric estimation of intensity, correlation, and spacing properties. The third part discusses model-fitting and statistical inference for point patterns. The final part describes point patterns with additional "structure," such as complicated marks, space-time observations, three- and higher-dimensional spaces, replicated observations, and point patterns constrained to a network of lines.},

The usual straightforward simulation algorithm suffers from edge effects, whereas our perfect simulation algorithm does not. By viewing Hawkes processes as Poisson cluster processes and using their branching and conditional independence structures, useful approximations of the distribution function for the length of a cluster are derived. This is used to construct upper and lower processes for the perfect simulation algorithm. A tail-lightness condition turns out to be of importance for the applicability of the perfect simulation algorithm. Examples of applications and empirical results are presented.},

	abstract = {In this talk we will discuss the algorithms for simulating point processes. The simplest point process is the (homogeneous) Poisson process, which has an intensity function of a constant value λ. It can be simulated by the sum of its interarrival times. By allowing the intensity to vary, taking values given by a deterministic function λ(t), we can extend the Poisson process to the inhomogeneous case. As proposed by (Lewis and Shedler, 1979), inhomogeneous Poisson processes can be simulated by “thinning” the points from the homogeneous versions. Further by allowing the intensity at time t to depend on all information prior to t, we get the self-exciting processes such as the Hawkes processes. The simulation of such processes can also be performed by thinning, as given by (Ogata, 1981).},
